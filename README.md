# Python Learning Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repository contains all my Python practice files, assignments, and projects as I progress through different topics in Python. Each chapter focuses on a specific concept, starting from basic programming to advanced topics like object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Topics Covered
1. **Modules, Comments, and pip**
2. **Variables and Data Types**
3. **Strings**
4. **Lists and Tuples**
5. **Dictionaries and Sets**
6. **Conditional Expressions**
7. **Loops in Python**
8. **Functions and Recursions**
9. **File I/O**
10. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## How to Use
Each Python file is self-contained and can be run independently. You can clone this repository and run the scripts using Python 3. Follow the instructions in the comments of each file to understand the examples better.

### Practice Problems
Every chapter includes practice problems that help reinforce the concepts covered. Solutions are provided in the same file for easy reference.

## Projects
- **Snake, Water, Gun Game**: A fun game built using Python.
- **The Perfect Guess**: A guessing game project.
- **Jarvis**: My attempt at building a voice assistant using Python.
- **Auto Reply AI Chatbot**: A chatbot that replies to user inputs based on predefined conditions.

## Future Plans
I'm currently expanding my knowledge in ethical hacking and AI, with Python being the foundation. Stay tuned for updates!
